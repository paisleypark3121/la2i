Negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus in shells or energy levels. The number of protons in the nucleus determines an element's identity and its chemical properties, while the overall number of electrons balances the positive charge of the protons, making the atom electrically neutral.Atoms are the building blocks of all chemical elements and are crucial to understanding the structure and behavior of matter in the universe."
