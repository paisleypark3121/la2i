chainlit create-secret
This command generates a key that has to be inserted in the .env file
(BEWARE: it is necessary that the KEY doesn't contain strane patterns as = in the middle; you recognize that it is correct in .env file in VSCODE because CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET is blue and its value is ALL WHITE)
