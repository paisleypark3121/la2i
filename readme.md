CHAINLIT AUTHENTICATION
In ordero to handle Chainlit authentication it is necessary to generate a Chainlit key:
chainlit create-secret
This command generates a key that has to be inserted in the .env file
(BEWARE: it is necessary that the KEY doesn't contain strane patterns as = in the middle; you recognize that it is correct in .env file in VSCODE because CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET is blue and its value is ALL WHITE)
It is necessary to insert the default ACCESS username and password:
LA2I_USERNAME=**USE YOUR KEY**
LA2I_PASSWORD=**USE YOUR KEY**

TUTORIAL - DEPLOY ON HUGGINGFACE SPACE

1. Create the Dockerfile: see Dockerfile file

2. Create a new space in HuggingSpace with deploy option Docker

3. Create access token in HuggingFace: settings -> access tokens -> create a new token in WRITE mode

4. Github secret: in Github repo -> settings -> secret and variables -> actions -> new repo secret
   create the HF_TOKEN with the value of the token configured in HuggingFace

5. Create the .github/workflows/ directory to store your workflow files:

- actions_onpull.yaml
- actions_onpush.yaml

6. set origin: git remote set-url origin https://GITHUB_USERNAME:HF_TOKEN@huggingface.co/spaces/HF_USER/HF_SPACE_NA;E

7. git pull origin
if we receive an error such as:
0d39db0...eadd02d main -> origin/main (forced update)
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
it is necessary to use the command:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
but BEWARE: the readme.md file will be overwritten, therefore keep your copy!

8. change again the url:
git remote set-url origin GITHUB_URL_HERE

9. perform the changes and then push

in order to handle authentication on HuggingFace it is necessary to configure the chainlit secret in the HuggingFace space:

1. access the HuggingFace space associated to the application

2. settings -> Variables and secrets -> secrets -> new secret -> add CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET with the value generated
